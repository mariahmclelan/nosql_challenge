Evaluating ratings data to help journalists of a food magazine decide where to focus future articles. Using json files I created a database using pymongo and mongodb. Once I created the database I added one additional restaurant that was left out. Then I analyzed the collection to find information. The magazine had some specific questions that they wanted answered, which through queries and analysis of the database I was able to answer.
